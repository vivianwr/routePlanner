Multi-Destinations Route Optimized Planner  

When I am traveling, I find that there is a problem I have all the time and Google Map cannot help me very well and waste time and money.

So I decide to design a web application to fit this problem.  And when I use Google Map APIs, I find that Google has already thought of this kind of problem and APIs have lots of methods to help me to achieve this problem.  Thanks Google a lot and Google has made our programmers easy to achieve our thoughts.

For the problem:
I have a few places to go, such as a grocery store, a gas station and a place to eat breakfast, and my origin point and destination point is given, then search the optimal route to go.  Each of the places has several selections.  How to find the optimal route by using minimum time?

Since the number of destinations is really small, only five or six, and the total is less than 100, so the algorithm is not difficult, while it takes a few time for google to find the route.

So as you can see, it's just a small and simple web application, but it's useful.
